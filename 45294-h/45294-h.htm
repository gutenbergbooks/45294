		<p>
      Wake from your sleep, sweet Christians, now, and listen.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A little song
    </p>
    <p>
      We have, so sweet it like a star doth glisten,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And dance along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now wake and hark: all brightly it is glowing
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With yule flames merry,
    </p>
    <p>
      And o'er it many a holly sprig is growing;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And scarlet berry.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bough of evergreen, with wax-lights gleaming,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      It bravely graces;
    </p>
    <p>
      And o'er its lines the star that's eastward beaming
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Leaves golden traces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, our little song; it sweetly praiseth,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Like birds in flocks
    </p>
    <p>
      When morning from her bed of roses raiseth
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Her golden locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this it is that makes most sweet our story,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When all is said:
    </p>
    <p>
      It holds a little Child with rays of glory
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Around His head.

      THE SILENT CHILDREN.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE light was low
      in the school-room;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The day before Christmas day
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Had ended. It was darkening in the garden

      Where the Silent Children play.

    <p>
      <br />

    <p class="indent10">

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The noiseless sport suspended,

    <p class="indent10">
      The voiceless tasks all read,

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The little deaf-mute children,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As still as still could be,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Gathered about the master,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Sensitive, swift to see,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With their fine attentive fingers
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And their wonderful, watchful eyes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      What dumb joy he would bring them
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      For the Christmas eve's surprise!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The lights blazed out in the school-room
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The play-ground went dark as death;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The master moved in a halo;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The children held their breath:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "I show you now a wonder&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The audiphone," he said.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He spoke in their silent language,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Like the language of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And answering spake the children,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As the dead might answer too:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "But what for us, O master?
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      This may be good for you;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "But how is our Christmas coming
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Out of a wise machine?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For not like other children's
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Have our happy hours been;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "And not like other children's
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Can they now or ever be!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But the master smiled through the halo:
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      "Just trust a mystery,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then to the waiting marvel
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The listening children leant:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Like listeners, the shadows
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Across the school-room bent,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      O my children, for a little,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As those who suffer must!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Great 'tis to bear denial,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But grand it is to trust."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      While Science, from her silence

    <p class="indent10">
      Of twice three thousand years,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">

      Led up like an arrow

    <p class="indent10">
      Then stalked to that sleigh.

    <p class="indent5">
      Ah, what a fine dose!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      He flashed out one claw, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Tweaked Santa Klaus' nose.

      He seized his reins in the funniest fright,

      All rosy and bright&mdash;

    <p class="indent5">
      From some long-since exploded world;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of comets frisking among the stars.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With tails like fiery trains of cars,

      For tides, eclipses, climes and seasons;

    <p class="indent5">

      Moons and comets and meteorites,

      His fingers in mittens, his chin in a wrap,

    <p class="indent5">

      His coat-tails flying away on his track&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Entangled far off in the Pleiades,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      On the horns of the Bull and Orion's knees.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For there was the Moon, and, strange to say,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      There too was the Earth, just over the way,

    <p class="indent5">
      Like the Doctor's globe, or a huge balloon,

    <p class="indent5">
      Forty times larger, perhaps, than the Moon,

    <p class="indent5">
      All covered with circles, and looming in space:

    <p class="indent5">
      There were groups upon it, and every face

    <p class="indent5">
      Was turned one way; and very long-jointed

    <p class="indent5">
      Telescopes at the sky were pointed;&mdash;

    <p class="indent5">
      And there, with a terrible rushing and humming

    <p class="indent5">

      As a circus rider dives through a hoop!

      With a crash,

    <p class="indent15">
      And a smash,

    <p class="indent10">
      And a roar as of thunder,

      It quivered,

    <p class="indent5">
      When all was done, with a dexterous twirl
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of his fingers, he set it once more a-whirl,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      While the Moon looked pleased as a smiling

    <p class="indent15">
      girl.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Off he sped; and the planet spun
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Away on its axis round the sun;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When, watching with curious eyes, I found
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He hadn't made it precisely round!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The zones, moreover, were strangely mixed:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Constantinople was squeezed betwixt
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      St. Petersburg and Baltimore;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      South Carolina and Labrador
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To Massachusetts were snugly tied;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      New York and Paris were side by side;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And, oddest of all earthly fates,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      England was in the United States!

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Greenland (he couldn't have made a greater
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Mistake) was on the new equator!

    <p class="indent5">
      While in each crack of the crust some bit
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of broken China was made to fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Whereupon I cried, with a wild halloo,

      "Hold on! come back! this never will do!

    <p class="indent5">
      Just see what a botch you've made!" Before

    <p class="indent5">
      He had time to turn, with a clang and a roar,

    <p class="indent5">

      Of the Christmas-tree and its many delights,

    <p class="indent5">
      Though often "sweet William," or "little Willee,"

    <p class="indent5">
      &mdash;Four years and a half or three-quarters was he&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Say! What kind of a tree is a Chrissermus-tree?"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the while they discoursed, as his wonder grew',
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With questions like these he followed them through:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Does it have big branches that spread all around?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Do its roots stay deep down in the dark ground?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Does it grow, grow, grow, way up very high?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      If you climb to the top will your head bump the sky?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Do any plums grow on it, or apples, or cherries?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or any good nuts, or pretty red berries?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Does it bloom out all over with flowers white as
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      snow,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As that tree does down there in our garden below?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Do robins and king-birds build nests in that tree?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And other birdies too?" asked little Willee.

    <p class="indent5">
      "Yes," answered Ned, wise, school-boy Ned:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "A Christmas-tree, young curly-head,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Has branches, sure, but has no roots,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And on its branches grow no fruits;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Yet bright red apples there you'll see,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And oranges of high degree&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Apples and oranges on one tree!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "That sounds very strange," quoth little Willee.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "No flowers bloom there, snowy white,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Yet with these fruits&mdash;a curious sight&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Are oft seen flowers both red and white!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Should you climb to the top without a fall,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Your head might bump against the wall,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But not against the sky, you see,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For indoors-stands the Christmas-tree!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "You tell very big stories," quoth little Willee.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "No birdie there doth build its nest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      No king-bird, blue-bird, robin redbreast,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Yet eggs thereon are often seen.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of beautiful colors, pink, and green,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And purple, and lavender, fit for a queen.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Even eggs with pictures on them are found.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And with golden bands which circle around.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But from all these eggs so fair to see
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Are hatched no birds in that Christmas-tree;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Instead, are hatched candy and gumdrops!" said he.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Are you telling the truth?" asked little Willee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "I've not told half, I do declare,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of all those wondrous branches bear.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Bear? They bear dolls and whips and drums,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Tops, whistles, taffy, sugar-plums,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And candy sheep, and candy cats,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And candy birds, and candy rats,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And India-rubber girls and boys,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Bear trumpets and all kinds of toys,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Bear books, and jumping-jacks, and mittens,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And little cotton-flannel kittens;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And over the whole of this Christmas-tree
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Candles are burning right merrily!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      What think you of this? my sweet Willie-wee?"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "I think you are fooling!" said little Willee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Next morning young Willie, with serious air,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Put earth in a flower-pot, and buried up there
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A seed of an apple with very great care.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Pray, what are you doing, you rogue Willie-wee?"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "I am planting a seed for a Chrissermas tree!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Is not that good to do?" asked little Willee.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      &mdash;There came from that seed a green little shoot
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Which put out its leaves and firmly took root,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And so finely did thrive that at last it was found
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Too large for the house and was set in the ground,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Where it grew up, a tree, one scarcely knew how.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Look down by the wall; it is standing there now.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      It blossoms in springtime, and many a nest
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Has been built there by king-bird and robin redbreast;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And other birdies too oft come to the tree
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And sing there and swing there, oh, so merrily;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They make it all summer our joy and delight;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And in fall of the year 'tis a beautiful sight
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When the clustering wealth of its apples is seen&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Its ruby red apples all set in their green!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      &mdash;And Willie? Yes, he grew up, too, young Willie-
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      wee,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And went as a sailor-boy over the sea.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He sailed in a ship to some far distant shore;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A storm came&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;we saw him no more.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      It was long, long ago that deep sorrow we bore!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The lads who were talking, as happy as kings,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of the coming of Christmas and all that it brings,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Are fathers now, so stately and tall.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Their children play by the garden wall,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And swing on the boughs of the apple tree,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or climb to the top, the world to see;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      (Some have gone from the home the world to see!)
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And when autumn comes, and leaves turn brown,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the ripened fruits are shaken down,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And here and there, on the orchard ground,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The red and the golden are heaped around&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      'Tis the children who gather that tree by the wall,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the apples from off its boughs that fall,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With kindly care are stored away,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Sure to appear on Christmas Day
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In platter or basket for all to admire,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or hung on strings before the fire,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      There to swing and sputter and roast,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      While many an one of the merry host
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Gives a tender thought to that first Willie-wee

    <p class="indent5">
      Who went as a sailor-boy over the sea.

    <p class="indent5">
      The youngest of all; a new Willie-wee,

      A shock of fear and shamed surprise

      Some childish word&mdash;"what would they

      do?"

    <p class="indent5">
      Then all at once a voice rang through

      Her troubled doubt, her troubled fear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "What will they do, why, this&mdash;and this!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And on her cold lips dropped a kiss,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And found her frozen figure crept
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A tender clasp.&mdash;She laughed and wept

    <p class="indent5">
      And laughed again, for this and this,

    <p class="indent5">
      This tender clasp, this tender kiss,

    <p class="indent5">
      Wras more than all her dream come true:

      CHRISTMAS.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>AMMA, what is
      Christmas?" How can I
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      say?
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      I will try to answer you "true as true."
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      It is just the loveliest, lovely day,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That is steeped in rose-color all the way through!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When miniature toy-shops in stockings are found,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That are left in the chambers without a sound;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And papa gives gifts with a tender cheer;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And brother "hurrahs for the top of the year;"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And sister looks on with her wistful eyes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With a soft, sweet smile at every surprise:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And Christmas means this:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A little child's bliss,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the love of the dear Christ felt like a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And a piled-up glory is hard to express;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And "What is Christmas?" is wonder for all.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      It is when the earth puts on holiday dress,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Made spotless fair with snowflakes that fall;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When hearts are lavish with treasures of love,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the pale, pure stars shine brighter above;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the dancing firelight seems to play
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In the most mysterious, haunting way;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the house fairies wander from sweet to sweet,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With an unexplored kingdom laid at their feet:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And Christmas means this:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A little child's bliss,

      And the love of the dear Christ felt like a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And still "What is Christmas?" Darling, come here.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      It is meant for the birthday, "true as true,"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of a beautiful child that was born in Judea,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That His mother loved, as I love you;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That grew up to teach you how you should seek
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To be in your spirit "lowly and meek,"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And onward higher and higher to go,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Till you changed to an angel, whiter than snow;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And offered freely (that all might take)
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The gift of Himself for the whole world's sake!

    <p class="indent15">

      A little child's bliss,

      Hushes his sad complaint,

      When the blue gentian's lids unclose

    <p class="indent10">
      In frosty meadows cold,

      When the green nooks they love so well

      Not quite unknown that presence

    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And strings of berries red.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A heaven-sent mission, surely,

      To cheer the sick and poor

    <p class="indent5">
      With bounties that the bounteous God

      To comfort dying hours,

      To bear to wretched hearts and homes
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The gospel of the flowers.

      What marvel if glad blessings

      Surround Saint Emily!

    <p class="indent5">
      What marvel if some loving eyes

      Land of Used-to-be, does little baby wonder?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Oh, we will clap a magic saddle over papa's knee,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And ride away around the world, and in and out and under,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The whole of all the golden sunny summer-time, and see!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Leisurely and lazy-like we'll jostle on our journey,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And let the pony bathe his hooves and cool them in the dew,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As he sidles down the shady way, and lags along the ferny
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And the green grassy edges of the lane we travel through.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And then we'll canter on to catch the bubble of the thistle,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As it bumps among the butterflies, and glimmers down the sun,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To leave us laughing, all content to hear the robin whistle,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Or guess what Katydid is saying little Katy's done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    <p class="indent5">
      And pausing here a minute, where we hear the squirrel chuckle

    <p class="indent10">
      As he darts from out the underbrush and scampers up the tree,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      We will gather buds and locust-blossoms, leaves and honeysuckle,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      To wreathe around our foreheads, riding into Used-to-be;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    <p class="indent5">
      For here's the very rim of it that we go swinging over&mdash;

    <p class="indent10">
      Don't you hear the fairy bugles, and the tinkle of the bells?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And see the baby bumble-bees that tumble in the clover,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And dangle from the tilted pinks and tipsy pimpernels?
    </p>
    <p>

    <p class="indent5">
      And don't you see the merry faces of the daffodillies,

    <p class="indent10">
      And the jolly johnny-jump-ups, and the buttercups a-glee,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the low, lolling ripples ring around the water-lilies,

    <p class="indent10">
      With a haze forever hanging in a sky forever blue,

    <p class="indent5">
      And with a breeze from over seas to kiss us as it passes,

    <p class="indent10">
      We will romp around forever as the little fairies do;

      The prankish Puck, king Oberon, and queen Titania too;

      conversation I once overheard&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Two children, a cat, a cow, and a bird.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The names of the children were Eddie and Jane;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The names of the others I did not hear plain.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      How came I to hear them? I think I won't
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      tell:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      You may guess, if you please; and if you guess
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      well
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      You'll guess that I heard it as many a man hears,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With his fancy alone, and not with his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Such a wonderful plaything never was known!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Like a real live dolly, and all for their own!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Two happier children could nowhere be found,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      No, not if you travelled the whole world around.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They had drawn her this morning where daisies
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      grew&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      White daisies, all shining and dripping with dew;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Long wreaths of the daisies, and chains, they had
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      made;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In the baby's lap these wreaths they had laid,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The children were drawing, with caution and care,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Their sweet baby-sister, to give her the air,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In a dainty straw wagon with wheels of bright red,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And a top of white muslin which shaded her head.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She was only one year and a few months old;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Her eyes were bright blue and her hair was like
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      gold;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She laughed all the time from morning till night,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Till Eddie and Jane were quite wild with delight=.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And were laughing to watch her fat little hands
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Untwisting and twisting the stems and the strands.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Just then, of a sudden, a lark flew by
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And sang at the top of his voice in the sky;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Ho! ho! Mr. Lark," shouted Jane,"come down here!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      We're not cruel children. You may come without fear.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      We've something to show you. In all your life
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      maybe
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      You'll never see anything sweet as our baby!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      'Twas an odd thing, now, for a lark to do&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I hope you won't think my story's untrue&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But this is the thing that I saw and I heard:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That lark flew right down, like a sociable bird,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As soon as they called him, and perched on a tree,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And winked with his eye at the children and me,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And laughed out, as much as a bird ever can,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As he cried, "Ha! ha! Little woman and man!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "You'll be quite surprised and astonished, maybe,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To hear that I do not think much of your baby.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Why, out in the field here I've got in my nest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      All cuddled up snug 'neath my wife's warm breast,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Four little babies&mdash;two sisters, two brothers&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And all with bright eyes, as bright as their moth-
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      er's;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Your baby's at least ten times older than they,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But they are all ready to fly to-day;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "They'll take care of themselves in another week,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Before your poor baby can walk or can speak.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      It has often surprised me to see what poor things
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      All babies are that are born without wings;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And but one at a time! Dear me, my wife
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Would be quite ashamed of so idle a life!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the lark looked as scornful as a lark knows
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      how,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As he swung up and down on a slender bough.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A cat had been eying him there for a while,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And sprang at him now from top of a stile.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But she missed her aim&mdash;he was quite too high;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And oh, how he laughed as he soared in the sky!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then the cat scrambled up, disappointed and cross;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She looked all about her, and felt at a loss
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      What next she should do. So she took up the
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      thread
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of the lark's discourse, and ill-naturedly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Yes, indeed, little master and miss, I declare,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      It's enough to make any mother-cat stare
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To see what a time you do make, to be sure.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Over one small creature, so helpless and poor
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As your babies are! Why, I've six of my own:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When they were two weeks old they could run alone;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They're never afraid of dogs or of rats&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In a few weeks more they'll be full-grown cats;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Their fur is as fine and as soft as silk&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Two gray, and three black, and one white as new
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      milk.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A fair fight for a mouse in my family
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Is as pretty a sight as you'll ever see.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      It is all very well to brag of your baby&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      One of these years it will be something, maybe!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And without even looking at the baby's face,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The cat walked away at a sleepy pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Moo, Moo!" said a cow, coming up. "Moo,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Moo!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Young people, you're making a great to-do

    <p class="indent5">
      They're nothing but braggers&mdash;I wouldn't give

      "Why, my little Brindle as soon as 'twas born

    <p class="indent5">
      Stood up on its legs, and sniffed at the corn;

      Before it had been in the world an hour

    <p class="indent5">
      It began to gambol, and canter, and scour

    <p class="indent5">

    <p class="indent5">
      And its comely red hair that so glossy lies

    <p class="indent5">
      And thick! he has never felt cold in his life;

    <p class="indent5">

    <p class="indent5">
      "Poor shivering things! I have pitied them oft,

    <p class="indent5">
      All muffled and smothered in flannel soft.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Ha! ha! I am sure the stupidest gaby
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Can see that a calf's ahead of a baby!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the cow called her calf, and tossed up her
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      head
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Like a person quite sure of all she has said.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then Jane looked at Eddy, and Eddy at Jane;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Said Eddy, "How mean! I declare, they're too

    <p class="indent15">
      vain

    <p class="indent5">
      "To live&mdash;preposterous things! They don't know

    <p class="indent5">
      a bird, or a kitten, or a learned calf.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That can kiss like our baby, or smile, or laugh!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Yes, indeed, so should I!' said Jane in a rage;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "The poor little thing! She's advanced for her age,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For the minister said so the other day&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She's worth a hundred kittens or calves to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as for young birds&mdash;they're pitiful things!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I saw a whole nest once, all mouths and bare wings,

    <p class="indent5">
      And they looked jis if they'd been picked by the

    <p class="indent15">
      cook

    <p class="indent5">
      To broil for breakfast. I'm sure that they shook

    <p class="indent5">
      With cold if their mother got off for a minute&mdash;

    <p class="indent5">
      I'm glad we have flannel, and wrap babies in it!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      So the children went grumbling one to the other,

    <p class="indent5">

      The dear baby, asleep, in its crib she laid,

    <p class="indent5">

    <p class="indent5">
      "Do you think I believe that the sun can shine

    <p class="indent5">
      All the suns I have ever seen
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Peeped from over a mountain screen,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Stretched a finger of rosy light
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Through some crevice to paint "Good-night;"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Up the darkness the great round moon
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Floated by like a red balloon,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Hung and glittered awhile, until
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      It went to the people behind the Hill.

    <p class="indent10">
      The earth spins round, the mountain is still

    <p class="indent5">
      Men and women they come and they go,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Children play in the valley below.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Winds are roaring, or winds are whist,

    <p class="indent5">
      Sun may pass, there is rain and mist,

    <p class="indent5">
      The world we know is a bright world still,

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The valleys are pleasant, and days are long
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With play and study, with work and song&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But a boy keeps planning for other things,

    <p class="indent5">
      There's room in his restless body for wings,

    <p class="indent5">
      And fancy will never fold them until
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He sees for himself what is over the Hill.

      But most I dream of the unknown sea

      Where brave ships hasten like birds set free,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Where plunging breakers ride high and loud

    <p class="indent5">
      Till the sailor is lost between wave and cloud.

      How midsummer comes following after June,

    <p class="indent5">
      And shall I pitch it by the lark or robin?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      For songs in midsummer should be in tune.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And shall I give it sweetness like the roses?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      For midsummer has roses, as you know,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As well as June; and sprinkled o'er with spices
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      From beds of pinks and poppies in a row?

    <p class="indent5">
      Perhaps like them; or, maybe 'twould be sweeter,

    <p class="indent10">
      My little song, and prettier sound to you,

    <p class="indent5">

    <p class="indent10">
      For midsummer has always lilies too.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Around the meadow-sweet the bees they cluster
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      So thick the children pick it not for fear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Like meadow-sweet and bees, if I could make it,

    <p class="indent10">
      A pretty little song 'twould be to hear!

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Down in the field a crowd of flowers are standing;

    <p class="indent10">
      The locusts pipe, the flowers keep sweet and still&mdash;

    <p class="indent5">

      Some ignorant and merry-hearted thing;

    <p class="indent5">
      For, I suppose, a song of the midsummer

      IN THE BLACK FOREST.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>P through the
      great Black Forest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      So wild and wonderful,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      We climbed in the autumn afternoon
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      'Mid the shadows deep and cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      We climbed to the Grand Duke's castle
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That stood on the airy height;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Above the leagues of pine-trees dark
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      It shone in the yellow light.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Around the edge of her wee white cap
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      We saw how the peasant women
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Were toiling along the way,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In the open spaces, here and there,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That steeped in the sunshine lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They gathered the autumn harvest&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      All toil-worn and weather-browned;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They gathered the roots they had planted in spring,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And piled them up on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      We heard the laughter of children,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And merrily down the road
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Ran little Max with a rattling cart,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Heaped with a heavy load.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Upon orange carrots, and beets so red,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And turnips smooth and white,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With leaves of green all packed between,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Sat the little Rosel bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The wind -blew out her curls&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A sweeter face I have never seen
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Than this happy little girl's.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A spray of the carrot's foliage fine,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Soft as a feather of green,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Drooped over her head from behind her ear.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As proud as the plume of a queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Light was his burden to merry Max,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      With Rosel perched above,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And he gazed at her on that humble throne
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      With the eyes of pride and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With joyful laughter they passed us by,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And up through the forest of pine,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      So solemn and still, we made our way
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      To the castle of Eberstein.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Oh, lofty the Grand Duke's castle
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That looked o'er the forest gloom;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But better I love to remember

    <p class="indent10">
      The children's rosy bloom.

      EDITH'S LESSON.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>UT in the meadow
      the scented breeze
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Was full of the gossip of birds and bees;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Out in the orchard the glad things flew,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And o'er meadow and orchard the sky was blue&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The sky was blue, and the clouds were white,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the summer morning was blithe and bright.

    <p>
      <br />

    <p>
      "<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
      is quite too lovely in-doors to stay,"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Said Edith, "whether I work or play."
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      So slate and pencil and fairy-book
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Were carried forth to a cozy nook,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Where the shadows glanced, and the sunbeams shone,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the dear little girl could be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      There were hard examples that must be done,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For father to see ere the set of sun;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And there was the merriest tale to read,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of a lady fair, on a milk-white steed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of a lady fair, and a stately lover,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the charm that lay in a four-leaf clover.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Study the lesson!" the robin said,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As he poised on the branch above her head,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With a whirr of wings like the beat of drums;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Edith," the bee hummed, "mind the sums!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But shadow and shine in their airy play
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Coaxed for the story that matched the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Any time will do for the tiresome task,"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Said Edith at last, "and I think I'll ask
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Papa to excuse my Arithmetic,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In such warm weather I might be sick
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      If I taxed this poor little brain of mine."
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      So she listened, you see, to shadow and shine;

    <p class="indent10">
      &mdash;'Twas a summer of Long Ago&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And looked through the gable window
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      At the river that ran below,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And over the quiet pastures,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And up at the wide blue sky,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And envied the jay his freedom
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As he lazily flitted by.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Yet patiently at her spinning,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      In a halo of happy light,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Se wrought, though a shimmer rippled
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The heads of the wheat in sight&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Though the garden was spilling over
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Its cups on the fragrant air,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the hollyhocks at the doorway
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Had never looked half so fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She saw, as her wheel kept whirling,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The leisure of Nature too&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The beautiful holiday weather
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Left nothing for her to do:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The cattle were idly grazing,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And even the frisky sheep,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Away in the distant meadows,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Lay under the shade asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      So sitting, she heard sweet laughter,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And a bevy of maidens fair,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With babble of merry voices,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Came climbing the chamber stair;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "O Dorns! how can you bear it,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      To drone at your spinning here?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Why, girl! it's the heart of summer,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The goldenest time of year.

    <p class="indent5">
      "Put out of your hand the distaff,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      This wearisome whirl relax&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      There are things that are gayer, Dorris,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Than sitting and spinning flax:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Come with us away to the forest;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      When it rains is the time to ply

      Such tiresome tasks&mdash;and to-day is
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The fifteenth day of July!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With a face that was softly saddened,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Sweet Dorris looked up and said,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As she ravelled a bit of tangle,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And twisted again her thread,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Nay, nay, I must do my spinning;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      It wouldn't be kind or right
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That the loom should be kept a-waiting;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      My hanks must be done to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      So the frolicsome maidens left her,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      With something of mild surprise
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That Dorris should choose a duty,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      With pleasure before her eyes;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Not dreaming that when her mother
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Her "dozens" should count up-stairs,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And kiss her and say, "My darling!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Her day would be glad as theirs.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      So she minded her wheel, and blithely
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      She sang as she twirled it round,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And cunningly from her fingers
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The delicate fibre wound;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And on through the sunny hours,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That neither were sad nor long,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She toiled in her sweet obedience,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And lightened her toil with song.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Aye, surely, the day is lovely!
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      It tugs at my very heart
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To look at its drifting beauty,

    <p class="indent10">
      Nor share in its joy my part r

    <p class="indent5">
      "Come hither, happy birds,

      Where the nests are hidden;

    <p class="indent5">
      There's a hush among the bees,

    <p class="indent10">
      As to roam forbidden;

    <p class="indent5">
      There's the silk of corn that shows

    <p class="indent10">
      Faded tangles blowing:

      There are insects' wings that gleam;

      Locusts shrilly calling;

      There are silences that seem

      Into sadness falling;

      There is not another rose

      Darling, summer's going.

      There's the mist that haunts the night

      Into morning sailing,

    <p class="indent5">
      Leaving filmy webs of light

      On the grasses trailing;
